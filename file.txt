1-Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.
2-I’m not cute or built to suit a fashion model’s size   
3-But when I start to tell them,
4-They think I’m telling lies.
5-I say,
6-It’s in the reach of my arms,
7-The span of my hips,   
8-The stride of my step,   
9-The curl of my lips.   
10-I’m a woman
11-Phenomenally.
12-Phenomenal woman,   
13-That’s me.
14-
16-I walk into a room
17-Just as cool as you please,   
18-And to a man,
19-The fellows stand or
20-Fall down on their knees.   
21-Then they swarm around me,
22-A hive of honey bees.   
23-I say,
25-It’s the fire in my eyes,   
26-And the flash of my teeth,   
27-The swing in my waist,   
28-And the joy in my feet.   
29-I’m a woman
30-Phenomenally.
31-
32-Phenomenal woman,
33-That’s me.
34-
35-Men themselves have wondered   
36-What they see in me.
37-They try so much
38-But they can’t touch
39-My inner mystery.
40-When I try to show them,   
41-They say they still can’t see.   
42-I say,
43-It’s in the arch of my back,   
44-The sun of my smile,
45-The ride of my breasts,
46-The grace of my style.
47-I’m a woman
48-Phenomenally.
49-Phenomenal woman,
50-That’s me.
51-
52-Now you understand
53-Just why my head’s not bowed.   
54-I don’t shout or jump about
55-Or have to talk real loud.   
56-When you see me passing,
57-It ought to make you proud.
58-I say,
59-It’s in the click of my heels,   
60-The bend of my hair,   
61-the palm of my hand,   
62-The need for my care.   
63-’Cause I’m a woman
64-Phenomenally.
65-Phenomenal woman,
66-That’s me.
